# DIABETES-PREDICTION
ü©∫ Diabetes Prediction
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on clinical and demographic measurements. The model is designed to support healthcare professionals with early risk assessment.

üìÇ Dataset
The dataset contains medical records of female patients, with each observation including:
 
 Feature                       Description

 Glucose                   Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dL)                                        
 BloodPressure             Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)                                            
 SkinThickness            Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)                                             
 Insulin                   2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)                                              
 BMI                       Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)                              
 DiabetesPedigreeFunction  Diabetes pedigree function (likelihood of diabetes based on family history) 
 Age                      Age in years                                                                
 Outcome                   Class label (0 = No diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)
